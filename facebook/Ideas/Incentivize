Ways to keep people interested in playing the game


1. Earn points by entering creating/longer words.  The more points you earn the more perks you get such as:
	- ending the game when you want wihtout the other users consent.  (make it so those with few points can only end a game if the other person agrees, once you earn a specific amount of points you have the power to end the game when you want.)


Point System

*Decide exact point allotments 

In players view, displayed will be:

What they've earned:
*Total points
*Badges

*Their Ranking?

*How they can earn more points

Need to put code in to check for duplicates
Need to tell the Games collection updateGameInfo code to save active correctly.
